# SERVIZ Experiments
This repository contains the ```bash``` run scripts to reproduce the experiments contained in the SC'22 ```pap427```. There are two directories, representing
experiments before the rebuttal (C1-to-C10) and experiments performed after the rebuttal (C11-C30). Experiments belonging to different configurations are "bundled" together to prevent the wastage of computing resources on Theta's ```default``` queue which requires a minimum of 128-node jobs to be submitted. 

**Note**: You may have to modify the values of environment variables before running the scripts (depending on your directory structure), so _please read the README_ file in each of these directories and go through the all the relevant ```*.sh``` files before running these experiments.
